Multi-view Diffusion
Multi-view diffusion is a type of diffusion model that turns an image of an object into multiple views of that object.

Setup
Install the required libraries.

Here, we use a custom requirements file to install a large number of dependencies. This is because the Diffusers library doesn't officially support multi-view diffusion.
